This is my first day using Obsidian Notes on my phone. I don't really know how I am going to use this, but it seems like a good way for me to keep track of my notes. There is alot of information out there, but it also isn't all that organized for someone really getting started. One thing I did do is create [[Obsidian Plugins]] as a way to keep track of all the plug-ins that could be useful. It may be a good idea for me to make a [[YouTube Video Ideas]] note with different videos I could make. I want some of these notes to be password protected, so I will see if I can figure out a way to do that. I like learning new things and this seems like a cool way for me to take and track my notes. I still don't fully understand how all these links and tags work, but I will just try them out and see.
