If AI is the number one skill for today and for the future, the core soft skill (or power skill) connected with it has to be…you guessed right. Creative thinking.

You can have all the artificial intelligence innovation and technology at your fingertips, but if you don’t inherently possess creative thinking skills and are able to generate creative problem-solving approaches, you’ll fall into the trap of producing basic AI slop, yielding outputs that are “meh” at best, and eventually look like a copycat of every self-proclaimed thought leader on LinkedIn. You won’t be a genuine version of who you really are as a leader and professional.

It will show on your job too, and can result in disastrous consequences for your work's output.

Creative thinking is listed as the number one skill on the rise from 2025-2030, across every industry globally, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2025.


In fact, about 57% of employers surveyed by the WEF currently recognize creative thinking as a core skill, one that cannot be replaced by AI; and the figure is slightly higher in the U.S., with 63% of employers viewing this as a must-have within the United States alone.


And yet, I can’t begin to tell you how many times I’ve encountered professionals on LinkedIn and in my coaching experience who still don’t know how to think and act creatively, outside the box.


That's where ChatGPT can be a valuable partner.

Instead of using it to think for you and to be your brain, use it like an assistant, a second brain, to amplify your own creativity. Instead of replacing creative thinking, it can stretch and strengthen that creative problem-solving muscle.

Here are a few helpful ChatGPT prompts to future-proof your career for 2026 and beyond with creative thinking skills:

You’re a creativity coach and business/leadership consultant. Give me three to five unconventional approaches or slightly “wild” ideas to solve [insert your business or leadership problem]. For each idea, explain in detail the reasoning behind it, the potential positive impact, and how and why it challenges conventional thinking.

How to use this ChatGPT prompt: This prompt is ideal in situations where you work as a coach, consultant, or leader/manager in a stakeholder/leadership meeting.

ChatGPT Prompt #2: Idea Fusion

I’m currently facing [describe the scenario you’re facing at work which requires you to reach a compromise, but you’re not sure which side to take or what compromise needs to be made]. List three ways I can combine XYZ approach from XYZ, and ABC approach from ABC to produce [desired effects i.e. design a new product, restructure the business model, produce a GTM strategy]. Explain why this hybrid idea could work and how it would benefit all stakeholders involved.

How to use this ChatGPT prompt: This prompt is perfect for product and project managers, GTM managers, and founders.

I am currently working on [describe your project or product in detail]. The goal is [describe the goal]. Reframe how it could be viewed and the personalization needs, including potential impact, from five different perspectives: stakeholder one [name who they are], stakeholder two, stakeholder three, stakeholder four, and stakeholder five.

How to use this ChatGPT prompt: This prompt is fantastic for product, program, and project managers, and other roles where you’d be a decision-maker including, and especially in, content and marketing roles. Every now and then it’s good to have an alternative viewpoint, especially in situations where your voice and that of other decision-makers are all on the same page and there’s little diversity or representation (especially of end users) in the room. This promotes the best outcome for those whom the product, program, service, or marketing campaign would be targeted at, and it helps your end result feel personalized instead of it being generic or robotic.

Christmas Prompt: Ai prompt: 

Create an ultra-realistic 8K Christmas portrait using a 55mm lens with bright, playful holiday lighting. The woman is in a whimsical holiday themed photoshoot, surrounded by Christmas decorations, snowy ground, festive trees, and oversized ornaments.

Use her real facial features exactly as they are — do NOT change or alter her face in any way. She already has a beautiful smile with her specific teeth. She has long dark brown hair parted to the side, styled in a soft textured holiday updo with loose face-framing curls. She is slightly glowing from the Christmas lights around her. Her makeup is festive glam — winged liner, warm eyeshadow, rosy cheeks, and a bold holiday soft pink lips.

She wears a sparkly white long-sleeve gown , fitted with a high thigh slit and shimmering with sequins. The back of the dress has a scoop-back cut, adding keeping the holiday sparkle. She is sitting on a white cube block, posing with one leg lifted and crossed, similar to the reference image. Her expression is playful and confident, smiling warmly toward the camera.

In her hand, she holds a giant red-and-white candy cane prop, resting it over her shoulder in a fun, candy-land pose. Around her is a fully decorated Christmas set:
• Snowy ground with fluffy artificial snow
• Christmas trees dusted with frost, decorated with classy ornaments and string lights
• Oversized candy canes framing whimsical beside her
• A large shiny red Christmas ornament near her feet

Lighting should be bright, clean, and festive, capturing the glimmer of the sequins and the  pink candy-themed props. The colors are vibrant reds, whites, and silvers, giving a magical North Pole holiday studio vibe.
