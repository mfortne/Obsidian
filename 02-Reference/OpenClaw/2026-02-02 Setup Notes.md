# 2026-02-02 Setup Notes

## What we set up today
- **Brave Search integration:** We configured OpenClaw to use Brave for web search (Brave API key added). *(Note: earlier we saw a Brave error about an invalid subscription token—if that pops up again, we’ll re-check the key/subscription type.)*
- **Obsidian vault:** Created/organized the Obsidian vault and granted OpenClaw persistent read/write access.
- **Obsidian ↔ OpenClaw connection:** Linked OpenClaw’s workspace to the vault so Frank can write notes directly into Obsidian.
- **Sync:** Vault is syncing with **GitHub**.

## Current structure + file naming
- Folder: `02-Reference/OpenClaw/`
  - `Daily/` → daily check-ins
  - `Weekly/` → weekly notes
- Daily filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD Daily Check-in.md`
- Weekly filename format: `YYYY-[W]WW.md` (ISO week)

## Status
Everything is wired up — now we’re going to do some actual work. lol
