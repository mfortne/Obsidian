- Daily
- Percent out of the money
- Premium
- Decision process:
	- look at ticker price
	- Look at do I have put or call
	- Where did get for premium (big enough profit take the profit)
		- If call ensure strike price is not less than price paid for stock (Don't sell overall stock for loss, take the premium loss)
- Sell options not Buy (Buying options is gambling, selling is a strategy)
