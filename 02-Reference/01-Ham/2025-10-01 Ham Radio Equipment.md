Maestro Ham Radio
- SSB (single side-band is a type of Amplitude modulation)
	- We listened to some on the 40M band
	- Below 9 MHz use Lower Sideband
	- Above 9 MHz use Upper Sideband
	- Top of 20M is 14.350
## Types
- FM - Frequency Modulation
	- <b>Voice signal amplitude</b>
	- For communications typically 10-15 KHz
	- Demodulator known to capture the strongest signal
	- Packet Radio (TNC -Terminal Node Controller)
		- Connect radio to computer to send messages
	- Packet Radio uses FM or PM (Phase Modulation)
		- Both Amplitude and frequency can affect
	- PSK (Phase Shift Keying)
		- Digital Modulation process
	- FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)
		- Used for RTTY
	- CW goes the furthest for the power used
	- <b>SSB is the voice that goes the furthest</b>
	- Digital Voice is newer voice
	- FM clearest voice

NTSC used by Amateurs in UHF
- Approximately 6MHz (a lot of bandwidth)
## Questions:
## Transmitters and Receivers
- Squelch Control (Carrier operated)
	- Absence of signal, mute the sound
	- Some repeaters require squelch to activate
	- Input devices for you radio
		- Keys, Paddles, Microphones, and Keyboard
		- Electronic Keyer
			- Used to enable sending morse code from a paddle
		- Microphone connectors
			- 8 pin - there is no standard
			- Lots of Adapters to convert
			- Too much causes distortion
		- HF Transceiver Terms
			- VFO - the Big Knob
			- Multimode - AM, FM, SSB...
			- Memory Channels - Memory slots for set frequencies
			- Multiband - can operate on more than one frequency
			- Tuning - adjusting recieve or transmit frequency, can use VFO
			- Sensitivity - Ability to DETECT a signal
			- Selectivity - Pick WHICH frequency
		- Receiver Controls
			- AF
			- IF
			- IF Passband Tuning
			- Match the transmitted bandwidth for best reception
		- AGC (Audio Gain Control) - Protect your hearing
		- Receiver Incremental Tuning
			- Fine tuning control for reception
			- SSB Voice can be made to sound normal with this
		- S Meter
			- Signal Strength (received)
			- 1 S Unit = 6dB power change - 4x Power
	- Noise Blanker (NB)
		- Squelches the audio during noise peaks (electric fences)
		- RF Preamplifier
			- Installs between the antenna and the receiver
	- Transmitter Terms (TX Audio)
		- Mike gain control
		- Speech processor control
	- RF Power Amplifier
		- Linear Amplifier
		- VHF UHF Power Bricks
			- SSB require Linear Amplification
			- CW or FM uses Non-Linear
			- Too Much power "Overdrives the Amplifier"
	- Computers and Ham Radio
		- Need these three
			- Audio from Radio to Computer
			- Audio from Computer to Radio
			- PTT (Push-to-Talk) Activation
	- Transverter
		- Converts both transmit and Receive to a different band 
### Digital Communications
- RTTY got their start on land
- Software runs these now
- Packet Radio (dating from the 1970s
- Uses AX.25 with Header, Checksum, Data, and ARQ (Automatic Request Que
- APRS (uses GPS receiver
- Can transmit short text messages
	- APRS.fi
- Winlink - ability to send emails over radio
	- Used Gateways to connect to the internet
- Digital Modes on the High Frequencies
	- 300 Baud (low data rate)
- FT-8
	- WSJTX K9AN and K1JT
	- occupies only 50 Hz Bandwidth
	- Great for low power DX
- Digital Terms
	- BER - Bit Error Rate
	- Parity Bit - extra for error checking
	- Digipeater - Store and Forward
- IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
	- 13 cm
Power Supplies
- Mobile VHF/UHF use 13.8V DC 15A
- Mobile HF use 13.8V DC 30A
- Regulated voltage prevents fluctuations
- Amp Hours divided by Avg current = Run Time
