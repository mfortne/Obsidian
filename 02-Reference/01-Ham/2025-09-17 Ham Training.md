### Ham Radio Class 
#hamradio
- Voltage is the pressure
- Current is accounting of the electrons
- resistance is oppositiion to the flow

- Power Energy consumbed by device
	- Voltage E Volt
	- Current I Ampere
	- Resistance R Ohms

- DC vs AC
	- DC voltage stays the same (Car Battery, Chemically store)
	- AC voltage flips positive and negative (60 Hz in US)

- Meters display amplitude in numerical scale
- Ammeter is in Series with Circuit
- Voltmeter is in Parallel in Device under Test
- Capacitor in a DC circuit
	- Low Resistance, rising to a high resistance (capacator in circuit)

How much Power is delivered to a circuit with 13.8 volts and 10 ampres of current
- PIE	P=IxE
- 10*13.8 = 138 W
How much power is delivered to a circuit with 12 vdc and 2.5 amperes
- 
- 2.5*12 = 30 W
How much current is required to deliver 120 W at 12 vdc
- PIE
- I=P/E
- 120/12 = 10 amps
What is the resistance of a circuit in whchi a current of 3 A flows when connected to 90 V
- EIR
- R=E/I
- 90/3=30 Ohms
What is the resistance of a circuit for which the applied voltage is 12 V and the current flow is 1.5 A
- R=E/I
- 12/1.5 = 8 Ohms

## 3.2 Components and Units
Resistors - Opposes DC current flow
- Zig-Zag line - measured in Ohms
Potentiometer
- Aka variable resistors
- measured in Ohms
Capacitors
- Made of two or more conductive surfaces separated by an insulator
- Capacitance measured in Farads
- Block DC current flow
- Resist Ac flow by storing in Electrical field
Measure Inductance
- Measured in Henrys
- Inductors pass DC current flow
- Inductors resist AC current flow, storing in a Megnetic Field
- Two inductors wrapped around one makes a Transformer
	- Step down, more to less
Impedance
- Opposition to AC Current flow
- Impedance unit of Measure in the Ohm
Switch Type
- Single Pole Single Throw
Relay
- Electrically controlled switch
Protective Devices
- Will open the current if too much current is drawn
Semiconductors
- Diode - Only flow in one direction
	- Cathode identified with the STRIPE
- Field Effect Transistor
	- Source, Gate, and Drain
Resonant Circuits
- Series Resonant ciruit - Tuned
- Parallel Resonant
Impedance Expressed using Polar Coordinates
## 3.3 
Oscillator
- Generates a signal on just one frequency
Filters
- Different types of filters
Simple filters (High-Pass, Low-Pass)
Transmitter
- Oscillator - Driver- Telegraph Key- Power Amplifier
Modulation
- Adding information to be carried by a radio frequency signal
Super Heterodyne Receiver
- Most common type in the past
