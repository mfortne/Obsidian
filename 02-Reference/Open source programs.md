There are great open-source applications available for most any task. Here are some of my favorites.

### ZDNET's key takeaways

- If Windows is your preferred operating system, consider these open-source apps.
- There are numerous open-source apps available for almost any task.
- These are all free to install and use on Windows.

---

I've been using [open-source software](https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-10-favorite-linux-distributions-of-all-time-ranked/) for a very long time. In fact, the last time I _didn't_ use open-source software, Bill Clinton was president of the US.

Open-source software is available for nearly every operating system on the market, from desktops to phones, and I often find open-source apps are superior to their proprietary counterparts. [If you're a Windows user,](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-most-windows-like-linux-distros-because-old-habits-die-hard/) you don't have to remain locked into closed-source software, because there are so many alternatives from which you can choose.

**Also: [Want to ditch Windows? This Linux distro makes that transition easy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-ditch-windows-this-linux-distro-makes-that-transition-easy/)**

Let me introduce you to some of my favorites.

## 1. LibreOffice

LibreOffice has been my [go-to office suite](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/5-stand-out-libreoffice-features-that-make-it-my-go-to-office-suite) since way back when it was a twinkle in the eye of StarOffice, and I haven't looked back since. LibreOffice includes all the tools you're used to in an office suite and even includes a database component (similar to MS Access). And with a customizable user interface, you can work with a modern UI or one that recalls the days of yore. 

**Also: [6 ways LibreOffice is better than Google Docs for serious writing work](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/6-ways-libreoffice-is-better-than-google-docs-for-serious-writing-work/)**

LibreOffice is installed locally, so you don't have to worry about a third-party cloud service accessing your information. You can set LibreOffice to automatically save in the MS Office default formats, so collaborating with those using Microsoft's tool is a no-brainer. 

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is free to download and install for Windows.

## 2. Flow Launcher

[Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/) is a quick file search and app launcher for Windows. With Flow Launcher, you use a customizable hot key to launch the tool and then search for whatever it is you're looking for. You can open apps, search for files, and browse the internet with your default search engine. Flow Launcher includes themes, animations, and sounds, and even allows you to build your own customizations. There are also community-created plugins to extend the feature set. 

**Also: [Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 days left - and 5 options](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cant-upgrade-your-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-days-left-and-5-options/)**

Flow Launcher is free to download and install.

## 3. Duplicati

[Duplicati](https://duplicati.com/) is a zero-trust backup solution that can back up from Windows (or any OS) to any destination you need. You can back up to Dropbox, Box, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services, or you can back up to other machines on your LAN for more privacy. Duplicati allows for scheduling and remote management, and it has a straightforward installation. Your backups are fully encrypted, and you can easily monitor them for real-time insights via a well-designed dashboard. 

**Also: [Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-windows-pc-has-a-secretly-useful-backup-tool-heres-how-to-access-it/)**

Duplicati is free for personal use.

## 4. Nextcloud

If you're tired of using Google or Microsoft's cloud-based offerings (especially out of fear that they are using your data to train LLMs), there's always [Nextcloud](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-easily-install-a-cloud-service-at-home-in-an-hour-or-less), which is the open-source, locally run equivalent to cloud offerings. Nextcloud includes everything you need for file storage, sharing, collaborating, communicating, organizing, and more. There's also an app store where you can install plugins to extend the feature set. 

**Also: [The best cloud storage services of 2025: Expert tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cloud-storage/)**

You can install and use Nextcloud on Windows for free and even install the [Nextcloud Desktop client](https://nextcloud.com/features/#clients) for even easier usage.

## 5. Franz

If you use several messaging apps and services, you might want to consider [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/), as it brings all of those messaging apps into one user-friendly GUI. Franz allows you to add WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Google Calendar, Discord, LinkedIn, Trello, Office 365 Outlook, Google Keep, and more together, so you don't have to switch back and forth between apps. You can add as many accounts as you want and easily switch between them without leaving the Franz UI. 

**Also: [5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymous](https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-tools-i-trust-to-keep-my-online-conversations-private-and-anonymous/)**

Franz is free to install and use.

## 6. YAZB

[YAZB](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb?tab=readme-ov-file) (aka YAZB Reborn) makes it possible to create custom Windows top bars (similar to that of MacOS) that can display helpful system information, such as battery status, internet speeds, weather, and more -- all with a clean, minimal, elegant style. 

**Also: [How much RAM do you really need in 2025? I broke it down for Mac and Windows users](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-much-ram-do-you-really-need-in-2025-i-broke-it-down-for-mac-and-windows-users/)**

YAZB also gives you quick access to shutdown/restart controls, customizable themes/icons/layouts, and allows you to add as many helpful widgets as you need.

## 7. File Converter

If you've ever needed to easily convert or compress a file in Windows, [File Converter](https://file-converter.io/) has your back. Using a right-click context menu entry (within the file manager), you can convert audio, video, images, and documents from one format to another. In the case of documents, you can convert nearly any format into a PDF. You can also compress files in the same way.

**Also: [How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for free](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-for-free/)**

The only caveat is that, in order to convert MS Office files, you'll have to have MS Office installed. You can customize the application order within the context menu and even add or remove presets. 

File Converter is free to install and use on Windows.

## 8. Bitwarden

If you don't use a password manager, you should start immediately. If you need a password manager, you should place [Bitwarden](https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-your-bitwarden-password-manager) at the top of your list. Not only is Bitwarden open-source, but it's also one of the best password managers on the market. 

With every feature you'll need (including a web browser extension), Bitwarden can do more to help keep you protected by simplifying the process of using strong, unique passwords. This open-source password manager includes a password generator (that can do both passwords and pass phrases), Bitwarden Send (to send files and text safely), and more. 

**Also: [NordPass vs. Bitwarden: Which password manager is best?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nordpass-vs-bitwarden-which-password-manager-is-best/)**

Bitwarden can be installed and used for free on Windows. You might even consider purchasing a license, as it gives you more collaboration features, which can come in handy with a large family or organization.

## 9. AutoHotKey

[AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) is an automation scripting language for Windows that allows you to define hotkeys for both mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons, and more. With AutoHotKey, you can automate just about any desktop task. 

**Also: [I always install these 5 free apps on every Windows PC - here's why they're essential](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/i-always-install-these-5-free-apps-on-every-windows-pc-heres-why-theyre-essential/)**

Essentially, this app makes it easy to work with hotkeys and macros, while helping you work more efficiently. There is a learning curve to AutoHotKey, but once you've learned it, you'll be glad you took the time to do so. 

AutoHotKey can be installed and used for free on Windows.

## 10. Ollama

If you want to use AI but don't like the idea of a third party using your queries or data to train their LLMs, consider the open-source [Ollama](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-app-makes-using-ollama-local-ai-on-macos-devices-so-easy), which is easy to use and even includes a well-designed GUI for interacting and adding models. 

**Also: [This is the fastest local AI I've tried, and it's not even close - how to get it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-is-the-fastest-local-ai-ive-tried-and-its-not-even-close-how-to-get-it/)**

With Ollama, you can work with a large [selection of models](https://ollama.com/search), ranging from the tiny to the very large. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the larger the model, the more system resources it will require. You would also be best served by using Ollama on a Windows machine with a dedicated GPU. 

Ollama can be installed and used for free on Windows.

### ZDNET's key takeaways

- The right add-ons can drastically improve your laptop's user experience. 
- The best accessories boost productivity and enhance comfort or usability. 
- There is no shortage of gadgets out there, but ultimately, the best are up to personal preference. 

---

Laptops are a complete package, but that doesn't mean the user experience can't be improved. Not everyone can use a trackpad effectively, and being trapped by your laptop's small display can hamper productivity. Fortunately, there are some excellent accessories that can significantly enhance the laptop experience. 

**Also: [The top 10 laptops our readers bought this year so far (no. 1 surprised us)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-top-10-laptops-our-readers-bought-this-year-so-far-no-1-surprised-us/)**

If you're running out of ports, consider checking out a dock or USB hub. If you're always low on battery, it'd be worth it to invest in a battery pack. If you find yourself squinting at the small display, consider investing in a portable monitor. 

We've personally gone hands-on with everything on this list, so to help you cut through all the noise, I narrowed things down to five accessory categories with multiple recommendations. Any one of these devices will let you get the most out of your machine.

Plugable 15.6-inch portable monitor

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Multi-screen setups aren't limited to desktops. Portable monitors let you take that unique layout on the go. While they can't match the immersion of a 4K gaming display, these smaller screens are perfect for travelers, professionals, or students who want a second screen. 

Even better, portable monitors these days are just one-click to set up, drawing power from the laptop and not requiring any additional software or hookups.

This [15.6-inch portable monitor from Plugable](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlugable-Pass-Through-Smartphone-Protective-USBC-PDMON%2Fdp%2FB0D9R8P9LL&app_deeplink=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78%7Cmwb&element=BODY&element_label=15.6-inch+portable+monitor+from+Plugable&group_uuid=0e2f8f60-9dc3-466a-a513-35791ee52252&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78) is around $240 on Amazon and a great affordable option. [We noted the monitor's portability](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computers-tech/my-new-favorite-travel-accessory-gives-me-an-extra-screen-to-work-and-play-on/) in particular -- easily slipping into a bag alongside your laptop.

Purchasing from Amazon will also net you a free smart case that doubles as both protection and a viewing stand. The price is competitive, falling in between higher-end options and budget models.

Customer reviews on Amazon praise the device for its high-quality visual output, even putting it above the display on the MacBook Pro.

Lexar SR500 2TB portable SSD

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

A common frustration I have when laptop shopping is being forced into costly upgrades just to get the storage size I want. For example, the [Dell 16 Plus](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?element=BODY&element_label=Dell+16+Plus&group_uuid=d228e4e0-6763-4ee8-aa27-4d3460c97d5b&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-9041660-15734614%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.dell.com%252Fen-us%252Fshop%252Fdell-laptops%252Fdell-16-plus-laptop%252Fspd%252Fdell-db16250-laptop%252Fusedb16250hbtshmgx%26sid%3Dzd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-mwb) with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor comes with a 1TB SSD. If I wanted a 2TB SSD, I'd have to move up to the Ultra 9 model, increasing the price by $350.

**Also: [The best external hard drives you can buy right now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-external-hard-drive/)**

Instead, you can invest in an external SSD, which is far cheaper than buying a forced upgrade (and way more flexible). [ZDNET's top-rated drive](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-doubt-youll-find-a-better-magsafe-accessory-for-creative-professionals-than-this/) is the [Lexar SL500](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?merchant=02zLDwCqTbhlnKCTPdI0yqf&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLexar-SL500-Portable-USB-3-2-Gen-2x2-SSD-with-Magnetic-Set-2-TB-LSL500M002T-RNBNG%2F13260110987&element=BODY&element_label=Lexar+SL500&group_uuid=cf10d4cd-b884-4f9c-86d8-191b7964a61b&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78). The base option offers 1TB of storage with lightning-fast 2,000 Mb/s read and 1,800 MB/s write speeds, and it's about the size of a credit card, so it easily fits inside your pocket.

For a more durable option, I recommend the [WD My Passport Ultra](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07GKFHCZ2&app_deeplink=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78%7Cmwb&element=BODY&element_label=WD+My+Passport+Ultra&group_uuid=989c9de8-9fdb-4ef0-8300-cab3172716be&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78). It is cheaper, but can also take a beating, with a sturdy metal enclosure and a 256-bit AES encryption for added security.

## My favorite power banks

![Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W](https://www.zdnet.com/article/open-source-free-windows-apps-boost-your-productivity/)

Ugreen Nexode power bank, 20000mAh

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

I'll be honest: I don't like carrying around laptop chargers. They take up too much space in my bag (even the slim ones), and you have to hope there's a free outlet wherever you go. A better option is investing in a power bank. 

The two most important features in a laptop-ready power bank are battery capacity and wattage. Aim for one with a 20,000mAh battery, so the device can actually recharge the computer. For wattage, buy one that delivers up to 100W for fast charging. 30W power banks technically work, but they'll take forever to recharge a laptop, and if you're using it, it may not recharge at all.

**Also: [The best power banks you can buy in 2025](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-power-banks/)**

A great choice is the [Ugreen Nexode 2,000mAh 130W](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-reliable-power-banks-ive-tested-is-not-made-by-anker-or-baseus/). It's powerful enough to charge multiple devices at once with 20,000mAh and three ports. However, it's one of the more chunky chargers, weighing about a pound. It's currently [around $70 on Amazon](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging%2Fdp%2FB0CXHNGDC1&app_deeplink=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78%7Cmwb&element=BODY&element_label=around+%2470+on+Amazon&group_uuid=9b91bca8-68bb-4336-b7dd-e0f040bf332f&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78).

Laptops have certainly gotten more lightweight, but one of the trade-offs is the limited port selection. The [M4 MacBook Air](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-highly-recommend-the-m4-macbook-air-to-most-people-and-now-its-on-sale/), for example, only has Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack -- hardly enough for a busy professional who needs to connect flash drives, monitors, and charge all at once. That's where USB hubs come in to save the day, hooking you up with all the extra ports for your gear. 

**Also: [The best laptop docking stations you can buy](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/best-laptop-docking-station/)**

[One of my favorites](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-recommend-this-6-in-1-usb-accessory-to-every-macbook-air-user-especially-for-work/) is the [EZQuest 6-in-1 USB-C Slim Hub Adapter](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D71ZPBK6&app_deeplink=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78%7Cmwb&element=BODY&element_label=EZQuest+6-in-1+USB-C+Slim+Hub+Adapter&group_uuid=5d85e758-1444-46e7-ab26-b2f3518fd303&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78). It is a pocket-sized hub, weighing just three ounces, but offers six USB-C ports. Four of these provide data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The fifth delivers 4K video signals at 60Hz, and the sixth supports 100W power delivery. Its removable cable enables better portability when needed, and the aluminum chassis makes it notably tough. All of that is to say that this is probably the only dock you'll ever need.

## My favorite lightweight laptop mice

HP 280 wireless mouse

Kayla Solino/ZDNET

A laptop's trackpad is fine for casual browsing; but a proper mouse offers better precision, speed, and comfort -- three qualities crucial for long work days. Speaking from personal experience, there's nothing quite like a mouse that minimizes hand strain. Your body will thank you.

**Also: [The best silent mouse you can buy](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-silent-mouse/)**

For a budget-friendly mouse, check out the [HP 280](https://cc.zdnet.com/v1/otc/00hQi47eqnEWQ6T9d4QLBUc?merchant=05kie42h3YvHwjr4G1w80Qq&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHP-Wireless-Silent-280M-Mouse%2Fdp%2FB08MKXVNZQ%2F&app_deeplink=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78%7Cmwb&element=BODY&element_label=HP+280&group_uuid=9e00a2d7-b6a1-4c88-89b4-16890af03dae&module=LINK&object_type=commerce-link&object_uuid=177472f8-6b92-42cc-a27c-c9289fbd6a83&position=1&template=article&track_code=__COM_CLICK_ID__&view_instance_uuid=1159cc42-8463-449b-a247-5bb19bbfcd78). It is a silent computer mouse [we praised](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-silent-mouse/) for its long battery life and ergonomic design. It's compact size makes it easy to throw into your bag, and it's very power efficient, lasting up to 18 months on the same pair of batteries. Not bad for a $22 mouse.

## Why should you trust me?

I've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now. And in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. My experience has made me extremely selective about how I support and enhance my laptops. I want to make sure that the accessories I choose improve my experience in some way.

**Also: [The fastest laptops you can buy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fastest-laptops/)**

I'm at a point in my career where I've practically tried out every type of laptop accessory on the market, from computer mice to docking stations and power banks. I know which features and specs people should look out for when shopping for a new accessory -- and which ones are not worth their time.

My advice is not a set of hard and fast rules that you absolutely have to adhere to. I just want to give you a good idea of what you should look for. What is best for you depends on your unique needs.
