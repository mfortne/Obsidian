It's been a wild wild weekend Saturday didn't do oh no Saturday we had the wedding we went to Lacey Shadow wedding for her friend Jenny who used to be Tillman's preschool teacher at Messiah Lutheran so we slept in and then woke up and got ready and got food and headed out it was a good ways away in like Marietta Slater area South Carolina and then went to the wedding she shot most of it and I was kind of the backup shooter I think I got some good shots we'll we'll see what she thinks she's doing pretty good she was then Super exhausted when she got home I guess growing a baby is pretty exhausting Jordan came home she had a Rippy sock vacation as she called it so she came over Sunday for a little bit and we just kind of hung out I did some laundry lacey played video games and just kind of rested we're trying to figure out what to do with Tillman he is fourth grade teacher left the school couple Fridays ago so he has a sub for a little bit and then he's going to have a long-term sub through January and then don't know what's going to happen after that so we started looking at some different homeschool options we found one got him accepted at connections Academy but then as we were talking to Tillman about it he's like I don't really want to go to that I just wanted to see what it was like it would be nice to not go to school all day and we were saying well like you still need to learn and if you're not learning it your school or learning at the level you need to then would like to look at something else I need to go look at them he got his SC ready scores is reading is the lowest but I think he's still kind of at or above where he needs to be but most of the others are like way way high like his I think his math and reasoning or something was like in the 99% tile and then overall which I need to try and understand the score a little bit more but overall his school for like a total score in this SC ready is in like the 400s and Tillman was like High 700s so he is definitely quite smart need to kind of try and figure out is that I think Lacey was saying that it kind of gets harder as you answer the questions correctly so I think that kind of like the act or something that it like the score is the same for everybody and adjusts for your knowledge level but I wasn't sure if you know he's a 700 and for fourth graders and all the other fourth graders are at 400 but then once you go to 5th and 6th grade then you're in the six or seven or if even 6th and 7th graders based on you know the the ratios that they'd still be at a 400 and he's at 700 so I don't really know that but also found out Monday last week that truest is making us come in 5 days a week starting in January so that's been a disappointment trying to figure out what to do for Tillman's birthday in 2 weeks he wants to go to a capybara Cafe there's one in Helen Georgia but it's kind of expensive for just like 30 minutes with the capybara's so Lacey was kind of looking to see if there was something somewhere else I think you said somewhere in North Carolina had something or do we do another like sleep with the sharks or pancakes and Penguins or some other thing if it's going to be
