This has been a crazy week. We had a new Teammate join our team and I am their leader. This had some challenges especially since Stephen and Rachel were out of the office for Wed-Thurs with leadership meetings in Greensboro. It has been super HOT in Greenville, like over 90 each day. This is especially challenging for me because I do not have AC in my car. I just cannot justify the $2,000 cost to repair it when the car is a 2010 Acura with over 150,000 miles on it. I think I could fix it for under $400, but that would also require like at least a whole day of me working on the car, so I am not quite ready to do that. I went to a new psychologist this week, and I didn't realize I would have to take a pee test, so I went to the bathroom before I left the bank for lunch and appointment. I tried to drink two large cups of water shortly before leaving but still was not able to provide a sample, I went back the next morning and provided it for them. That same day as I get back to the office I get an IM from a friend/co-worker that another friend/co-worker was let go. This was a major surprise, he didn't really have any indication, but it sounded like just a RiF (reduction in force) not anything
