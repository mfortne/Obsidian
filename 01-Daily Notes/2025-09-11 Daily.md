Yesterday was very busy. Yes, I had a few meetings get canceled and go short, but I was still busy just about all day. I was able to get all my work done, and things went OK. I had my 1:1 with Stephen and I brought up all my QO Fails he sent on Monday. He said that was "Really bad, and he almost wrote me up for it". I don't know that I have ever been written up at a job, and especially for something like this. It is an internal check, and I really only forgot to fill out one date field in a document. I understand the details are important, but I feel there should be like a scale, or something more then just a Pass/Fail. Whoa, my computer booted up really fast today. A couple of my meetings didn't start out all that well, because I wasn't quite sure where to start, so we stumbled along. It didn't help that Stephen was on them so I felt extra pressure, but we finally got to some actionable items and made good progress. I left a little late, as I finished up documenting all my projects. I have a few due tomorrow, that I wanted to make sure I was still on track for that date. I messed up when I got home. I started talking to Laicie without checking if she was ready to listen, then when she didn't seem to care, I looked away in frustration. She was paying attention and commented how she was in the middle of something else, so couldn't give me full attention. It wasn't kind for me to just expect something from her withou asking. So that wasn't a great start to the evening. Then she asked how the 1:1 with Stephen went and how asking for time to help her went. She was confused because she had asked me to ask about like a medical break, and I had only asked for like an extra half-day or something at home. It was a good calm conversation and she asked if I just ignored or forgot what she had actually asked for. I forgot, this really hurt her. She had a phone call to make so we ended the conversation. I went back and looked up the text she sent about it, and can see why she was so hurt. She had asked if I could take some time-off to help her. That is so hard for me because like I need to work, even asking for modified schedule is hard because like, what am I suppose to do to help her? How does me working from home an extra day or picking Tillman up give her any relief? Even asking for time off, like I do not understand just siting at home. I understand she is depressed, and struggling, but I can't just pause life to take care of her. I guess I need to talk to her about what exactly she needs, but that I hard too becaseu I feel like I should know, and she expects me to know. I feel guilty just sitting around, or me not doing my job to help her with watching Cannon. I don't know what to do. To top it all off, she was then helping her mom and talking to Wil last night, so yes I was in a funk feeling bad in how I treated her and that I "messed up", but anytime I went to talk to her she was busy. She felt I was angry with her and distant. So it was rough. This morning was a little better, we were not angry with each other. She seemed in a better mood then last night. Tillman on the other hand, was NOT wakeing up. I came down at like 6:09 to give him medicine and we still didn't leave the house until like 7:45. He said he was still tired and didn't sleep well. He fell asleep to me rubbing him before 9:00, but he woke up during the night, went downstairs and couldn't get back to sleep. His brain then always goes to the worst case and shuts down. Once he knew he was late, after 7:10 and was grounded for the day from technology he then has NO motivation to do anything else. He mentions, it isn't his choice that he is tired, so it isn't fair for him to be grounded. I am proud of myself because I really worked on my attitude and behavior and stayed calm and collected, even though we were WAY late to school. Laicie came down and asked if he didn't feel good, he took that to heart and really tried to exaggerated that he didn't. I didn't know at the time, that Laicie had actually gone to the doctor and tested positive for Strep, so he might have actually been feeling sick. I finally got him in the car and withheld my urge to be logical and explain his actions this morning. /he did not get any technology in the car, and about half way to school I mentioned #meshtastic to him. He seemed a little interested, then we talked about #99nights on Roblox, and I let him talk for a while. As we got closer to school I remembered a stock purchase I made (Hour) and how I had made $. 75, so I shared this with him and talked through if I had bought many more shares I could have made quite a bit more. Then I took him in to school, and scanned him in late. Now I am in the office, with just a few meetings, but I want to try to watch the Ham class I missed last night. Hopefully I can get a lot done today!
