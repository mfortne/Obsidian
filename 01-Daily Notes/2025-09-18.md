It was another very busy day at work. I was able to close 3 Smart requests along with the 2 I closed Tuesday, so I closed and completed 5 so far this week. It was a lot of work, I made sure I double and triple checked things, along with sent the list to Jimeka. Our plan is to be "buddies" and check each other's work after we complete. This way we can both learn from each other along with allow one more check before it goes to QO for review. I really do not want any more "FAILS" this year. Ohh the other crazy thing is like 30 min before I was leaving I went to move or adjust my shirt and noticed I had forgot to remove my gun from my waistband when I came back from lunch. I was like Ohh, shit, don't make a big deal about it. I knew it I didn't do anything it wouldn't be a problem, and it made me feel good too knowing that it was concealed enough that it wasn't detected. The other wild thing is as I walked out the building there were 2 police cars in the front of the building talking to security,. I don't know what it was about, they didn't have the lights on, so it must have just been something in the parking lot or similar minor issue. Then I also switched over to my Hotspot because there was a meeting 4:00-5:00 that I wasn't sure what it was. As I was talking to Jimeka she said "Ohh, maybe you are being recognized". She was right, Andy and I were recognized at the beginning of the meeting, it was funny because it was right as I was walking past the room they were in also. I will include the photo I took of the slide. I feel good, even though I don't feel I did much, it was a tool Andy built, I was the one to make sure I asked the LOB to send an email saying how big of a issue he found. He is building tools in python to pull data from PDF letters, and found an issue that they didn't even know about. They wouldn't have known until a few months later, and Andy was able to identify it and they fixed it, they also noticed a few other letters that were wrong also based on this issue. It was a big win for TOR, and the work we do. That was really fun.
