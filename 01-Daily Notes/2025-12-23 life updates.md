So been doing a lot of different things lately laces feeling much better with this old friend pump I'm getting ready for going to her cousins house for a Christmas meal today getting close to Christmas and going to have family over at our house for Christmas morning and afternoon I'm off work for the next couple weeks that's nice been doing a lot of hanging out with Lacey but that means there's some house chores and everything we need to get done. Tillman's out of school for the Christmas season when he goes back you'll have another new teacher because his fourth grade teacher #fourthbrain she this was her fourth year teaching but she for some reason didn't fit well at the school so she quit and then he had a short-term sub for a couple weeks and then a long-term sub came in but starting in January she is somewhere else for like a weekend we had him signed up on with an online school but he really kind of wanted to stay at East North Street so we dropped him out of that online school and he's back at East North Street I don't know what we'll do for 5th grade with him were kind of looking and seeing if he wants to go back to maybe Crestview or some other maybe an online school or something else. 

I'm kind of trying to wake up earlier in the mornings and get some stuff done on personal things that I wanted to play with so I played on with Brock and the courtney.net website so I've made some updates to that that's been fun still kind of just struggling mentally on what I like to do in my free time and what to work on just big Dreams and thoughts so working through that I did start the autism testing process through prosper health.com found it on Facebook which was interesting but as I've been looked into it they accepted my insurance and it was free which is nice because anywhere else that I tried to find autism testing it was thousands of dollars so being able to find something that was covered or free was a big win kind of need to look into it for my son also we think he might be on the Spectrum but just haven't gone that direction yet through that too I had the requested I had to get talked to a Prosper health therapist that's been interesting he's focused on ADHD versus my current therapist that's more family therapy focused and personal focused so it's been nice just last night we talked about boundaries and how boundaries are such a foundation for communication and kind of seeing that I'm probably a little what was it porous in my communication in my boundaries my emotional boundaries which makes it challenging to communicate and have those relationships especially with my mom and kind of pointing out that I like to just avoid communication and conflict wherever possible but then because of that don't have great boundaries and relationships based on those porous boundaries. 

This past weekend I went and visited Grandma at her house and with lacey Tillman and my mom to kind of do Christmas with her since not really doing anything on actual Christmas that was an interesting thing because of course lacey didn't really want to go because my my mom is such a challenge to be with and around so lacey didn't really want to go but I really kind of wanted her to come so there was a little bit of a we just discussed different things there and worked through it Tillman hadn't had his professing in a day or two so he was a little out of sort but overall did pretty good we need to make sure to write thank you notes maybe I'll try and do that with him today. 

I need to get better at typing or saying something regularly again I did it for a good while and then stopped I'm going to have to try and see I think this might work typing up my answers I might be able to do that easier in the mornings and get more out right now it's been such a while since I did it I also think it works well with my headset when I can keep playing and see how well this bluetooth headset actually works with voice typing so far it's working pretty good I just need to keep an eye to make sure it doesn't stop randomly whole sentence paragraph without getting anything reported but it's working pretty good even with all this background noise
