Yesterday was really busy. I am taking Thursday and Friday off this week, so I was trying to get everything organized and set up to not have anything to do Thursday and Friday. I am trying to find better systems at work because trying to keep 4 Infosys developers busy while still answering their questions is a huge undertaking. I have also been working with Jimeka who is going to be taking over the Infosys team, they keep telling me. I don't know how that is actually because I am *to* *work, we will see. It has also been frustrating because everything I have been working on with the developers seems to be so disorganized and WRONG. I have received confirmation on the requirements, and testing, then when it is automated, they say this is wrong. It has been hard on me, feeling like I messed up and not organized, but it hasn't really been my fault. I was handed a mess and no good direction while still trying to move SO fast. These developers have been able to knock most of these requests out in a day or two. I have struggled to keep up with them. They are starting to work on some bigger projects, but even those have been a challenge because the teams requesting them do not really know what they want. I have had to have multiple meetings to determine the original ask, while also trying to keep the developers busy as I gather these requirements. It would have been much better if I had been able to do this planning weeks ago, but we move so fast this isn't possible right now. #brianbaird stopped by on Monday and dropped off his book. I am excited to read it but I also didn't quite realize it was as long as it is. It is like 350 pages, but I am sure it will be good. Now I need to find time to actually read it, lol. Tillman and Laicie met up with Pam and her boyfriend at Main Event. Laicie sent me some pictures and it looked like they had a great time. Laicie told me Tillman is a good at negotiating which I both liked to hear and don’t, lol. She wanted to go into one store with her mom to get a birthday present, and wanted Tillman to not complain or be difficult. She told him if he was really good, she had a Roblox gift card. He came back with, if we go into two stores, he gets 2 Roblox gift cards, lol. Good thinking buddy, good thinking! My foot is doing very well today, I was telling Laicie when I got home that I didn't even feel anything on my foot by the end of the day. I sat with her in the garage as she finished up a ghost painting she painted on top of a cheap canvas picture she bought. It turned out SO good! Then I cooked Pizza and quesadilla for Laicie and we played some #overcooked! man some of these levels are getting very difficult, but with good communication Laicie and I are doing very well. We headed to bed a little early, I was drained from such a demanding day. I was working so hard to stay focused and ahead of all my work, knowing I was going to be totally free for the next two days. School starts for Tillman on Monday, so that is going to be a change to routine but we have been preparing him and getting ready ourselves. He is going into 4th grade, like how/what? He is getting so big and I am impressed at how smart and kind he is.*
