Wow it has been a while since I last wrote. It has been busy. I don't even know where to begin. Laicie and I are doing very well, I actually asked her to fill my drink last night as I was eating pizza last night. She was like "you have drink in it", I told her I usually need a refill before I am finished, and she was getting up so I asked. Ohh, I also was a little dirty before my colonoscopy, I knew nothing was going to happen, but I was courageous and jokingly asked her to jump on the bed with me, before they came in to get me all set up, lol. She laughed and was proud of me for having the courage to say something. What else, I got a new phone, before my colonospy we ran to Sam's Club, and I talked to the T-mobile guy. We decided to get the S25+ through Sam's, which waived the $35 activation cost along with gives us a $75 Sam's Gift card. That gift card will take a few months, but still nice. I am so happy I got this new phone, the battery is already nicer, along with it is much faster, my S22 was getting slow. Saturday we tried to watch the game, they ended up with a 1.5-2 hour delay because of the weather, and by the time it came back on, I had lost a lot of the excitement for the game. In addition to that we were not playing well and I think it was 0-10, them, going in to halftime. I spent alot of the day setting up my phone, signing in to the different apps, and settings. I was really impressed, well at first it seemed frustrating because the transfer seemed to be stuck at 99%. Then I canceled it and tried again as I was going to bed. It took about an hour, but all apps transfered, and even the layout of them all copied right over. It was like just using my old phone. Monday I had my infusion of #inflectra for #ulcerativecolitis and I was planning on going way early, but I realized as I dropped Tillman off that I left my old phone at home. I needed that for the RSA token to login to the Truist VPN. So I ran home grabbed that and still was about an hour early. It was nice that they were able to fit me in too, sometimes they are so booked, I still have to wait. While I was hooked up, I submitted the IT request to transfer my token to my new phone. That actually went very smooth also, and everything worked thr First Time! I stayed busy so the infusion seemed to go by really fast. My blood pressure was High, so I will need to message my GP to see what we want to do. It is so strange to me because I believe it is tied to my Adhd #adzenys even though it really shouldn't. Yes, it is a stimulant, but that shouldn't affect blood pressure. I also don't want to just add a new medication to treat the side effect of another one, but I also don't want to cause damage because of high blood pressure. I also need to schedule a Hearing Aid appointment, it has been too long, and I know I need some adjustments. Ohh while we were at Sam's, Laicie looked at laptops, so she/we could game better on Steam. She took some pitucres of the options and actually uploaded them to ChatGPT, to get advice. The one I recommended was also the one it recommended, so that made me feel good. Laicie went to Hamilton in the Theater with #kayla on Sunday, and they ran to Sam's after and she bought the laptop, since it wasn't available online. In doing that, they were actually phasing that model out, and it was the only one they had, so they sold her the display model and gave her an additional 20% off. This made it almost half off what I could find online. It is the FX507ZC-RS51, Online it is like $820, but we got it for like $479! She is happy and was so pleased that the Bluetooth controllers just worked with it, since she had to fight so much on the Mac to try to get them to work. Tillman and I met the #mimbila for hibachi at Sakura to celebrate Ruban's birthday. I should have know and just shared food with Tillman, because he didn't like or eat very much of anything. I really enjoyed it all and actually have Plenty of food to eat later. Then Tillman had planned to meet with #marhjun to play, so we tried to figure that out. They wanted to meet at like 5, but we were done with food at like 3, so I messaged Ashley and we met at Macpherson Park in Downtown Greenville to play for a little before going to the apartments to meet #marhjun. Somehow communication was off, probably because it was just the two 9 year-olds planning it, so Tillman and I sat at the pickleball court for like 30 min waiting on them. When they finally came, we all had a great time. I played pickleball with his parents and brother while Tillman and #marhjun, played and talked. I ended up playing like 5 games, and lost the last game, to lose the series with his brother. It was really fun, I forgot how fun it is to play. then I played a game Dad and son vs dad and son, mostly just hitting it back and forth. I really enjoyed being able to let Tillman play and enjoy time with his friend. Today is CRAZY busy for me, when I look at my calendar I have like 1.5 hours, total, that I am not in meetings. Additionally they are all ones I like need to lead or really be apart of not just like listen to. so I am going to be doing alot of note taking and talking today. I am going to check my emails quick before all that starts and I will continue working on staying consistent in typing thing each day.
