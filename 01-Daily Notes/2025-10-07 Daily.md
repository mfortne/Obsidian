So things have been quite interesting, I haven't made time to write in a while. I guess I will start with on Friday I get home and Laicie says "we have an errand to run". I have no idea what she is talking about so Tillman goes inside and we head out. She shows me a pregnancy test, and I am just shocked! We both don't really know what to do or say. It is exciting because we have wanted another child, but at the same time, we have found some good flow in our current family. I am scared, one that this excitement will not last, and two that something will happen and really devistate Laicie. On top of that, just thinking about being a parent to a newborn again, isn't super appealing. I am not looking forward to sleepless nights, or diapers. I am scared I will get very grumpy again and not be a great husband and dad. I know this is in my head but I don't know that I have felt excitement yet, because it doesn't feel real. When Laicie went to Labcorp on Friday for the blood test and she told the tech how she took the test because usually that seems to "help" her start her period. Then she sees she is pregnant he told her "I will tell you what I told my sister, Got you bitch". It was quite funny for Laicie. So throughout the weekend we have been processing it, Sat was so much fun we went out on the lake and boat with the Mimbelas. Laicie brought her big camera and got some great shots. We were able to get everyone up on the wake board. I was so suprised because event Tillman Asked to try. It took him 2 times and he was mostly up. I do think it was mostly because he wanted some Robux, but to hear him ask to try and not give up when he didn't get up on his first try was huge for me. I am starting to tear up right now thinking how proud that made me. We wene to Mexican after and I wasn't thinking and figured the moms would want margaritas, they did Not, lol. It was a great day and I talked Ruben's ear off the whole way home. I really need to learn to sit in silence.The kids all wanted a spend-the-night, so they had a great time. Then we didn't really mind but also didn't fully know how things would go when we agreed to that. Ashley had asked Laicie to watch Scarlett for a few days because she was going on the school field trip with Christian. We didn't fully know that was going to mean Scarlett was staying with us Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. If we had known we probably would have had Ashley come and get them during the day, vs all the kids at our house all of Sunday. Christian  was really struggling with going on the field trip, he was crying often that he didn't want to go and he "wasn't ready". He was nervous of going with people he didn't really know, even though his mom was going to be there the whole time. We finally helped him work through it and they headed home. I got Tillman and Scarlett to bed and they slept well. They were actually both up and downstairs before I was the next morning. I was able to get them ready for school and both made it to school on time. Laicie had texted a few times keeping me updated on getting a Dr appointment to start the baby doctor stuff. Then she called me around 10 freaking out because the car was acting up and the check engine light came on. She tried to go to O'Rieilys and they person there was so RUDE, he did read the codes, but when she asked he was like "No, you should take better care of your car". There was a C1241 code, and a Cylinder 4 misfire. I was pretty confident it was just corrosion on the battery, but Laicie was too scared to drive, so I started to head to her. On the way she figured out she could take Jordan's but still ended up driving hers. She was mostly upset with the O'Rieilys guy and just "one more thing". I cleaned the battery and doing so reset the check engine light and so far it hasn't come back on. Laicie started to work on a fun way to tell Tillman he was going to be a big brother and she decided on a word puzzle. She wrote each word In a different color and cut each letter out individually. Then we called him downstairs and recorded him piecing it together. I have to go back and see if I was able to capture his face, but when he figured it out he just got quite and shy, he didn't really tell us how he felt, but we could tell he was excited and overwhelmed. We told him it was still a secret and not to tell anyone, he asked if he could tell marjuan. We said that was OK. Laicie texted him later about it and he said " am not I didn't let it show but I am really really happy". Laicie then said he would be a great big brother and he said "Yes I will". I am still shocked and overwhelmed more than excited. Work has been very stressful and just keeping everything going. I do feel Laicie and I are in a really good place, I am scared I will mess things up, but I also know I am more prepared then ever to handle anything that happens. Laicie and I are in a really good place, and just don't know what the future holds. Well I should probably actually get to work, Stephen is sitting next to me.
