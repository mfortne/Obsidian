Okay I don't know how this is going to work let me see if I can use my headset one second okay can you hear me yeah I guess you can all right so I'm going to just talk out some stuff so there's a whole lot then going on since the last couple said anything since with hG Hydro amesis gravadanam or something so couple Fridays ago that continuously gives her Zofran she switched doctors because Upstate OBGYN I think that's what it was interesting very helpful for anything so she actually been to the hospital twice to get fluids because she was so dehydrated and stuff I've been struggling on me cuz she's been calling me to pick up Tillman or come work from home because she feels so bad we figured it out I think I've been pretty supportive to do a whole bunch of stuff around the house so she got the Zofran pump that was working well but then it was giving her really tight shoulders and then she was getting a headache from the tight shoulders so that's been rough I think the lower the dose she was on 4 mg an hour now she's on 3 going back to when it went a nurse came I think she ended up being from Charlotte and stayed here like 4 hours or something 1G gave Lacey and IV here at home she got like a wonderful bag of fluids that was interesting because part of the way through Lacey looked down cuz her arm was feeling a little weird and something happened with the vein so she just had a bubble in her arm so we had to switch it out trying to get poked again either in like the stomach or the leg s so I've been poking her it's a tiny little needle like almost looks just like a little packed and then it keeps the tacitor in there and then she just wanted to see her a couple days so that's been going pretty good within a couple days to hasn't done it and then she had such a bad headache from muscle tension and everything but again honestly lower the dose that seems to have really helped me at work still had been roughly made it to Thanksgiving with Seneca but then the next just around week she really didn't get out of bed yesterday is now to well the finally made you know been able to do a little bit of errands will's fiance get pick out or look at different dresses in Seneca and then she drove home I got filmed i have really hard conversation with my boss to try and figure out what some different options of working for home or anything would be to try and help lacey at home I should ask sooner but I was just scared to so I didn't and please I'm able to now work from home Thursdays and Fridays through the end of the year Fridays the normal work from home I already passed a few months and then work and a half day Wednesday in the office pick up till Monday and then work from home to again help lace out this evening struggling too but this past Thursday I speed up Tillman to work and just working there still in school and wasn't thinking and went on to work and at least he mess I did 30 or something like that I wanted you home I thought you were working from home because a whole crap but at that point like I had a 9:00 meeting I have 11:00 meeting so late by the time I tried to get in the car and make it home I would have been late to one of the meetings or not made it to another meeting and or would be leaving shortly to go pick up kill me that was a rough day as Lacey report thing to come out the night before at like 2:00 in the morning so she was really looking for me to help her and get the medicine in again and then I wasn't home to do that so the day without without it was kind of rough she a doctor's appointments that day that I'm kind of wanted to go to but again with my meetings and everything I couldn't achievements that was really rough day for her she's very depressed it was hard for me too I don't know what it's been going on the past couple days but that was I guess like Tuesday and like I came home and cook tacos and make tacos no Monday I came home cooked tacos ate tacos Monday Tuesday and then like it came up at 7:00 to send just a couple hours before we were going to bed and then like the next day I'm doing something else and had very little time with her so not only now it was please pick up some medicine but it's like I didn't spend time with her and then Thursday was interesting too because came home a Thursday when she went to Seneca a Thursday when she went to Seneca nope Thursday she was home and I work but then when you got home chilling was like oh today was the winter festival but Dylan didn't want to go with Mimi and her new husband Jim
