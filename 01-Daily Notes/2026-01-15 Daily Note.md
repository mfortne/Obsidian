Drive Home - Jan 14 Started off pretty good. Didn't take my medicine early cause it seems to jack up my heart rate. Donating blood at work at 10, so skipped it for that. Got a forty dollar gift card for donating. After that was fine, but around 12 Lacey texted—she's struggling bad. Wanted me to pick up Tillman. I had meetings, couldn't. I get frustrated. I wanna be that husband but I can't just leave every day. She's pregnant, HG. Out of her control. But it's so constant. Can't really talk to her about it—good days, I don't wanna bring it up. Bad days she's just... done. No bandwidth. Got home. Overwhelmed. Walked in, dogs had puked twice. She wants comfort, I wanna give it, but the house is a mess and I haven't even taken my coat off. Snapped at Tillman. He asked for a drink right as I was walking by. Tone changed. Get it yourself. Not helpful. Told Lacey later—maybe we brainstorm a better way for me to handle that. Dog mess is priority number one. Might've gotten into trash. Still got a bit of a drive left. Work was actually solid though. Got back in January fifth, caught up on emails with Copilot. Cleaned my Obsidian at work. Made a vision board. Using AI to teach the team. Kinda excited. But life's... crowded. Mom's unemployed. License gone. Going through autism testing myself. Tillman's anxious. Fourth teacher in fourth grade. Forgot his watch Monday, school lost it. Cried all day. Picked it up Tuesday, felt guilty for wearing it even though he's allowed. Wanna do special time again. Fifteen minutes. No distractions. Maybe start tonight. Home in ten.
