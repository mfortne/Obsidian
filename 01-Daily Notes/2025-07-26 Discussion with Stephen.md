## Prepared Conversation Starter with Manager

> _"I wanted to connect with you about something I’ve been thinking through. With the shift toward managing the offshore developers and working through some inherited requests, I’ve been juggling a lot of moving pieces. What I’m finding challenging is that some of the expectations, especially around what I should be driving or already have visibility into, aren’t always clear—particularly when projects move quickly or conversations happen without my involvement. That’s led to moments where I feel like I’m catching up rather than leading. I really want to be effective here, and I’d love to align on how I can get better context, timelines, and clarity upfront—so I can stay proactive rather than reactive."_

## Possible Follow-Up if Asked About Specific Challenges or People

> _"Yes, there have been some moments where I’ve felt a little out of sync with how work is handed off or discussed—especially when expectations aren’t clearly communicated or I haven’t been part of the context-setting. I’m not trying to point fingers, but I do think some alignment between how I’m expected to lead and how others are managing the same projects would really help me avoid duplication, confusion, or miscommunication. I’d love to eventually talk about how we can build more shared clarity or handoff structure."_
