It has been a while since I wrote some notes. Last weekend was a very fun one with some drama. We we went up the the lake house, where we stayed before in the AirBnB . With the Mimbal's for Christian's birthday. They brought the boat so we were able to have a lot of fun. I messed up and didn't plan my Friday well, so I had a bunch of meetings, and needed to pick up all the kids from school early. This made me stressed and I took it out on Laicie. Ohh crap I forgot the worst part of the weekend. On Thursday when Ashley and Laicie headed up, Laicie texted that she was driving so she was handing the phone to Ashley. I was trying to be cure and funny so I typed fast and as I hit send I knew it was going to be an issue. I wrote "Hey sexy, tell Laicie I think she is beautiful!", then since I knew that could be read wrong I sent "Can't wait to kiss you "Laicie", going to be so much fun!". Yeah, Laicie still had her phone at the moment, and broke down into tears, and didn't want to explain or tell Ashley what was happening. Laicie read it like I was having an affair with Ashley, and was so hurt. I tried to explain myself, but Laicie was also going into an area with less signal. It was rough. For the rest of the day, I felt really bad and was trying to figure out how to do something. By the time I was going to sleep Laicie and I had been able to talk and she understood. I work from home on Friday's but had a few meetings, and should have packed more the night before as I was rushed to get everything packed and in the car, I ended up forgetting some important things. I forgot the Melton, Trains, and checking that I grabbed the correct air mattress. Ok, my system is booted up and I have a few meetings, I will try to get back and write out more a little later today.
