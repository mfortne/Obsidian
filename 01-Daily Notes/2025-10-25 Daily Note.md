Hey I'm just going to talk through at this time I'm sitting in the car line it's been a crazy week Monday we had a meeting that they told us that starting January 5th of 2026 we're going to be expected to be in the office 5 days a week so it was then interesting cuz Steven had times like oh do you have any questions and it's just kind of like nothing you can answer how did they come up with this why did they decide this but none of those are ready to be answered it's just frustrating he was frustrated too and then so work's been going better I kind of figured out a system I'm staying on top of my projects Thursday then we had an ultrasound for lacey and did get to oh boy see baby so it's real sounds like we're about 7 weeks along . This means that the due dates like June 10th so that'll be yeah I'm still not not sure how I feel I'm excited but nervous I got to then take an ultrasound to work and told a bunch of people and then not working from home today Friday one of innocents the last days just through the end of the year of working from home we went to the open house at Tillman school last night on Thursday it was very disorganized didn't really know what was going on where then someone had said something and I started to think it was like wait a second is there a trunk or treat happening and a coworkers daughter has kids here and as I was thinking that too she kind of called me over and was like did you hear that the principal doesn't celebrate holidays I was like no I hadn't heard that but I was just thinking is there a trunk or treat and that makes sense that maybe now there's not a trunk or treat because the principal doesn't celebrate holidays so it's and then Tillman's teacher quit a couple Fridays ago so he has a sub for a little bit and then he's going to have that he had that sub for like a week or two and then he's going to have a longer term sub through January. So we're kind of looking at some maybe homeschool options or if he can change classes or just what what's going to make sense because it it's not helpful for Tillman to go through three or four different teachers and like what is the environment here at this school if his teacher who's new this year three of the four fourth grade teachers are all new this year and this teacher third year teaching quit before the end of the year.
