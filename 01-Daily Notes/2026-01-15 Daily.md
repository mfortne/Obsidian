Wednesday night... coming home was stressful. Lacey was struggling—quiet, hurting. Didn't wanna stress me, but she did anyway. Asked if I could stay home the next day. Didn't even know what Thursday looked like. My routine—gone. Got frustrated, but didn't snap. Told her I'd look in the morning. Did. Stayed home sick. Took Tillman to school myself. She was supposed to be resting till ten, eleven. Felt useless. So I just... went upstairs. Sat in bed. Next to her. Cleaned up all those Chrome tabs I'd been saving, read through a few articles. She woke up. We... got a little frisky. Nice. After, watched Amazing Race. Picked up Tillman. She found this spot online—Computer Source. Drove to Inman. Thirty minutes each way. Little store, lotsa filament. She bought more than I ever have. Felt... connected.
