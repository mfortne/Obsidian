This was was a rough morning, we tried to get Tillman to sleep sooner, but it was like 9 before he finally fell asleep. It is cute that he still asks for “rubbies" to fall asleep. He likes for me to pop his toes and fingers. Then bend all his joints before just rubbing his back or head to fall asleep. He bothers me at times because he will grab my hand to rub his waistband, I get it because it does feel good, but it is hard for me to give up control and not sure what he is trying to do. Even though it is the same thing just about every time, there have been a few he wants me to rub his belly button. Man just saying this makes me feel sad, that my feelings are more inportant than his, or that I take for granted he enjoys this and still asks for it at 9 almost 10. Ahh crap he is almost 10, where has time gone? Ohh my procedure went very well. I had good nurses Tori, Casey, and . Ali was the nurse that pulled the IV out. I apparently told Dr. Brackbill that I ate rocks when he said he had find some polups. I asked Laicie to take me to Firehouse Subs after, ohh it was so good. I got a LARGE Italian and they now have French fries! I finished it all and felt so much better. Laicie went to Chick-fil-A and actually got a sandwich, she was not impressed and I finished the last 1/4 or so of it. I was very hungry!
