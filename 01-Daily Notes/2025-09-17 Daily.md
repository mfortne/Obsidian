It was a good day, I feel I did good planning for our team call, and I knew my requests. Jimeka did text my phone on how LOUD Mo got when talking to me. She was like that is rude, and the loudest person isn't the most important. It was nice to have someone else recognize that dynamic. After the call I had so much to do. I think I worked the rest of the day staying organized on BRD's and closing a few items. I know I got 3 closed and I think I have at least one more I can close today. Well before all that I met with Mo to assign out new items, and send some meeting invites. I am in more meetings these days then actual work time, lol. Plus, it is getting hard to schedule meeting because everyone us so busy. I don't want to go out two weeks, but most people have conflicts. It is actually a joke the "Michael special", an 8:30 or 3:30. which is funny but even Stephen said "we ask him to schedule it and he schedules it!" I tried to reach out to a few people to meet to sell the car, but no one either responded or could meet last night. I do have someone who says they can meet at 5:00 tonight with $2500 cash, so we will see how that turns out. I still have a bunch of work today, and I have a what should be fun Teammate Growth Month class at 10:00. It is "How to Facilitate Great Meetings". I am excited about that one. I will be taking some good notes. Additionally this will be helpful because Stephen is starting to push for more organization with Agendas before meetings, and meeting minutes after the meeting. I do like this but it also means more work and I already have limited time in between meetings, so I will need to adjust my flow to stay on top of all these things. I feel like I am starting to hit a limit, which is a wierd feeling for me, I usually have more capability then work. I do like it and believe I can adjust my work flow to better manage it all. I know if I work ahead a little more I will have more time day to day, it will just be finding that line of what I can do early and what needs to be done in the moment. Well my computer is all booted up, so I will talk to you next time.
