This has been a very good weekend. I am trying to sell my White car since I got the Silver Acura. I have had a few people reach out but still haven't met anyone. I had someone who seemed very interested Saturday planning to met after 5 on Sunday, but when they didn't hear from me they made other plans and now can't really meet until Friday. I had someone else very eager, they said they had money and were in Greer, but when they asked about the AC, they backed out, the person "needed" that. In my listing I say, "AC doesn't work". I might lower the price, but at this point it is mostly people not following through, I have had over 10 people reach out. We just hung out most of the day, I made pancakes for the kids around 12. They had a lot of fun playing outside then they wanted to play #cityskyline on Steam. It was cute to see them all sitting next to each other playing in the garage. Also, to hear how they talk through things and plan their citys is fun to watch. Laicie and I played together on the couch for over an hour, while Ashley napped on the couch. I think I want to start a new city and plan it better, but I also started to just demo and fix the one I am currently playing. We will see. We watched a couple videos on YouTube, that were actually really helpful, I am going to use some of those tips and tricks going forward.
