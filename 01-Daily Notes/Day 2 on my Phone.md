# Notes:
This has been a pretty good week, Thursday was Juneteenth, so this has felt like a really long weekend. Falcon our foster dog went on Friday morning to get snipped, and Tillman was in a bad mood, I am guessing he maybe didn't take his medicine. This caused me to be in a wierd mood too. I was in my head so wasn't as kind and friendly as I would have liked. Laicie also didn't feel great, she had taken a gummy the night before, so that could have been it. Now I am at the pool with Tillman and Laicie. Tillman has been playing with Micha most of the morning, and he cam home with us for Tillman to eat before coming up to the pool. Tillman has most of his friends up here, Lincoln and Micha, so he is super happy. He had asked for the Gopro earlier but didn't record anything. I grabbed it for the pool but he hasn't used it yet. Last week I let him use the new Insta360 X4 I got with my points at work. That took a little figuring out because anytime the screen got wet it thought it was a touch and rotated the focus all over the place. After we figured out how to lock the screen, he used it and I think there is like 30 minutes of footage. I need to pull it and edit it, but my phone was acting up when I tried last week. I think it was overheating so was too slow to do anything. I am excited to get footage off of it and be able to finally use the app. As the last one I had the Insta360 X2 had issues and I could never use the app. Ok time to get in the pool with the family.
