Yesterday I slept good. Had a nice time with Lacey. We just snuggled in bed a while, both enjoying it, then went to sleep. Woke up normal, got everything ready like usual, went in to wake Tillman—he was extra slow this morning. Took forever to get him moving. Once he was up he started complaining, neck hurt, didn't feel well, didn't wanna go to school. I got really stressed 'cause it was already seven, seven oh five, and we're supposed to leave at seven ten. So I took a breath and changed my attitude real quick, stopped what I was doing, knelt down and asked him exactly where it hurt, how it felt, what was going on—just so he knew I was listening. Ended up it was stiff like he'd slept on it wrong. I rubbed it warm for a minute Not what I would say was bad enough to keep home, I felt he was kinda milking it, still not a hundred percent, probably would've just stared out the window all day at school. So I made him turn over all the tech—tablet, laptop, so he couldn't just lie there playing. He handed it over all dramatic like he was dying, then I stuck it in the garage so it'd be there if we needed it for the baby appointment later. Was gonna meet Laicie anyway. Sent her the sexy story I used grok to help me write a sexy story. She woke up about nine and texted me she wished she could've slept longer but her body just wouldn't let her. I think she washed her hair, then we met at the doc. Work was okay, got a few emails out, got stuff organized. Had asked Steven on Tuesday if it'd be cool to leave early for the appointment and finish the day from home—he never answered. He blew in about ten, guess he was still sick from Tuesday so I didn't say anything to him all day. Appointment went smooth. Baby right on schedule, twenty weeks, ten ounces, due date's holding. Took a ton of pics and video—gonna throw that up on YouTube once I sort 'em. Showed the ultrasound lady that little lithophane I made, the one that's like a flat 3d print of the scan? She thought it was awesome, said bring the full 3d model in next time once he's older. Already told her I'm already planning on it. Headed home after. Laicie texted, could I fill her tank? Winter storm rolling in. Kinda weird to me, coming from Chicago where we just bunker down—here everybody's losing their minds over two inches of ice. Stores out of milk, bread, you name it. After we got home I finished some work and Laicie texted that she had found this Rural King place, basically Tractor Supply meets Buc-ee's, so we drove to Spartanburg. We walked around a bit and she grabbed some real nice Muck boots, expensive but they'll last forever. Got ten one-pound propane canisters too—we've got that little heater in case the power drops. Few inches of ice could wreck the lines easy. Grabbed Olive Garden breadsticks on the way home. Got back and Tillman showered, Laicie showered, hot water was gone by then so I waited. Printed off a new version of that lemon keychain thing—last one was doll-sized, this one came out cantaloupe big, so I dialed it back to one fifty percent and it's perfect now. Showered last, crawled in bed, we watched Amazing Race till we passed out. Weather's rainy now, forty seven degrees—supposed to get nasty tomorrow, stay cold all weekend.
